For SFELLA, as expected, performance declined as granularity increased, particularly in the BreakableBottles environment where it previously had a clear advantage over \tloA{} (Figure~\ref{fig:exp3_main}). For UnbreakableBottles, performance declined as Utility Objective Granularity (???) was increased. In the Doors environment, performance declined, from significantly better (??? Table~\ref{tab:granularity_significance}) than \tloA{} to much, much worse. In the Sokoban environment, as in Experiment 1, \tloA{} was the better performer and remained so.

The result confirms that where SFELLA performs well, it does so because it avoids `granularity' and is sensitive to changes in utility right across teh scale. In contrast, \tloA{} is sometimes insensitive to changes that exceed its threshold. Where it is well tuned, it performs well, or even better, than othere algorithms, but when not well-tunred, it performs less well.
