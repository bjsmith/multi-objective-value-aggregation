\subsection{Results}

For SFELLA, as expected, perormance declined as granularity increased, particularly in the BreakableBottles environment where it previously had a clear advantage over $TLO_A$. For UnbreakableBottles, performance declined as granularity for the Reward Scaling was increased. In the Doors environment, performance declined, from signifantly better (???) than TLO_A to much, much worse. In the Sokoban evnrionment, as in Expermetn 1, TLO_A was the better performer and remained so.

The result confirms that where SFELLA performs well, it does so because it avoids `granularity' and is sensitive to changes in reward right across teh scale. In contrast, TLO_A is sometimes insensitive to changes that exceed its threshold. Where it is well tuned, it performs well, or eve nbetter, than othere algorithms, but when not well-tunred, it performs less well.
