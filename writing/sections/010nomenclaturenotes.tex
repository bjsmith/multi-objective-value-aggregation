\section*{nomenclature notes}
nomenclature we need to get straight:

\begin{itemize}
    \item names of each of the agents
    \item names of each of the environments
    \item scaling (are we scaling reward, performance, what? how do we describe R*)?
\end{itemize}

 
 
\section*{additional editing tasks}

 - RK: algorithms need to be improved
